    <h2 class="Main">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons oil or ghee</li>
      <li>A pinch of Hing (Asafoetida)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger or Ginger Chips</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Garam Masala</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chilli powder</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Cumin Seeds</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
      <li>1/2 kg cubed paneer</li>
      <li>1 cup milk of your choice (dairy, soy, almond, oat)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup almond meal</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="Main">Methods</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Add oil to a large pan and heat.</li>
      <li>Add the Hing (Asafoetida) and ginger and stir.</li>
      <li>Cook for approximately 2 minutes or until browned.</li>
      <li>
        Next, add in the salt, garam masala, chilli powder and cumin seeds.
      </li>
      <li>Cook for 2 minutes, stirring continuously.</li>
      <li>Add in the tomato paste, continue stirring and cook for 1 minute.</li>
      <li>
        You'll know you're ready for the next step once the oils have separated
        from the tomato spice mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the cubed paneer to the pan and mix to ensure the tomato mixture
        coats all the cubes.
      </li>
      <li>Add in the milk and almond meal.</li>
      <li>
        Cook for 5 more minutes until the mixture has thickened in to a gravy,
        and the colour is a nice deep orange.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put into a serving bowl and enjoy with steamed rice and roti bread.
        Delicious!
